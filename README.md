## The challenge was to find ways to make improvements to an online travel app by applying weather data.

City locations were identified using GPS coordinates, which was then supplemented by weather data for those coordinates.

The new application of weather data allows users to choose their preferred maximum and minimum temperatures for a potential vacation. 
This new ability to narrow a search by temperature builds on existing search capabilities of the app, now identifying hotels close to each city within the preferred temperature range. Additional weather data was included in a map marker layer allowing users to quickly browse among destination and hotel options.

The new ability to search by preferred temperature allows users to survey options at a global scale, suggesting possibilities the user may not have previously considered. Once a regional destination is identified by the user, they can then search at a more local scale to consider options for a travel itinerary. The map marker layer was applied at the global scale, but can also be used to plot potential routes by driving, bicycling, or walking, by visualizing start and end points with stops along the way. 

## The improvements made to the travel app could be extended by including additional search parameters based on weather data, such as rates of rain or snowfall. Historical data could also be applied to suggest ideal times of the year to visit specific locations. Local search capabilities could be expanded beyond hotels, to help users choose restaurants and other destinations to plot along their travel route.
